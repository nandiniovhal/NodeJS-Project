# NodeJS-Project
In this project I have created some signup authentication as well I have performed some curd operations on employees like add employee, view all as well any particular employee, update employee and delete employee. 

First, we need to include a few packages for our Nodejs application -
* npm init
* npm install express --save
* npm install body-parser
* npm install mongoose
* npm install mssql
* npm install nodemon
